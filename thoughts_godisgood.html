    <p class="body-text">
      Are You with me? Mom says so, but are You
      here? Dad doesn’t talk about you much, but he
      prays at dinner. Are you closer to some then to
      others? They tell me to look for You in
      everybody, but they also tell me to stay away
      from some. I don’t understand. The other day I
      listened to someone who doesn’t believe in
      You, and I really liked what He was saying. I saw
      You in Him. So why doesn’t He see You? Why
      don’t I always see You at church? And why does
      mom tell me You’ll always give enough, when
      she’s always worried about money? She prays
      over every meal, but after the prayer we rarely
      talk about You at all. How are You both
      everything and nothing?<br><br>
      I could really use Your help Lord. I’m going to
      camp tomorrow and well, I’m not sure I’ll have
      too much time to talk to You out loud. So ya,
      I’m gonna write here if that’s ok.<br><br>
      Ok, please be with me. Thank You for this day
      that You’ve made,<br><br>
      Amen Jesus
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      <strong>7/15:</strong><br><br>
      Dear God, please be close today. I’m unsure
      what it’ll be like there, but I do hope I can shine.
      That’s what mom said I should do. Dad said I
      should just have a good time. Please help me to
      be whatever it is that you’d like me to be.
      I Love You,<br><br>
      Amen Father God.<br><br>
      Dear Father, this is tough. Everyone’s older and
      I’m unsure if any of them will be friends. I pray
      for a friend Father. Just one to make this time
      ok. Ok, I Love You,<br><br>
      Amen Jesus.<br><br>
      Dear Lord, why am I here? It really doesn’t
      seem like a good place to be. I just don’t know
      why You’d let me come here if it’s like this? I am
      not ok God. I’m scared. I don’t like this at all.
      They want me to be someone I’m not and I
      don’t know if I’ll have the strength to tell them
      no. Please give me the strength. Thank you for
      all that you have already done. Thank you that I
      have already won. Help me to see You in them
      too.<br><br>
      Amen Jesus.<br><br>
      Dear God, why doesn’t Bryce see things the way
      I do? Is he right? Why have You taught me
      these things, but not him? Why does he seem
      to be at peace without You? How has he done
      so much with so many girls without feeling bad?
      Mom says that you give a piece of your soul to
      everyone you sleep with. Why is he fine then?
      He’s slept with a lot of girls God. Why am I
      doing this if it’s not a real thing? Are You there?
      How can You be there for some and not for
      others?<br><br>
      Amen Father God.<br><br>
      Dear God, Thank you for this day. Thank you for
      the friend. Thank you for Lexi. I pray you take
      this to exactly where You’d like it go. I am
      Yours,<br><br>
      Amen Jesus

      <strong>7/16:</strong><br><br>
      Dear Lord Jesus Christ the Creator of all, thank
      You for this wonderful morning. Thank You for
      loving me through the bad. Thank You for the
      friends I’ve made so far. Please be with Lexi and
      I as we get to know each other better. I Love
      You Lord,<br><br>
      Amen Jesus.<br><br>
      Why God? Why her? Why’d You let me get
      attached to her. Am I wrong? Am I the stupid
      one? Am I the one who’s lost their way? This
      hurt, and I’m supposed to turn my cheek to feel
      the rest of the pain? Why in the world would I
      do that? Why should I pretend that all this
      matters’, when so many don’t and are fine?
      Where do I set my worries? Who is listening?
      Why do I have to care so much? Why can’t I just
      sit there and not feel any of this?<br><br>
      Why’d you let Bryce sleep with Lexi?<br><br>
      Why was that ok?<br><br>
      When I told Bryce, I wanted to wait today, He
      laughed at me. Told me that He did too. Is this
      just the age that we grow out of You?<br><br>
      Is that what’s supposed to happen now? Should
      I just finally let go? Pick you back up when I get
      older and have kids, so I can teach them how to
      say please and thank you.<br><br>
      So, I can scare them off from sex, and get them
      to ask for less for Christmas presents?<br><br>
      Is that what You are? Just a selfish lie.<br><br>
      You’re not here. You’re not anywhere are You.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      <strong>7/17:</strong><br><br>
      Thank You. I’m so sorry. Thank You Lord for
      loving me through the bad.<br><br>
      Thank You for being there last night. Thank You
      for keeping me safe. Thank You for Your
      strength. I didn’t deserve that. Thank You for
      Your love.<br><br>
      She needed to be seen the way You’ve seen me.
      Thank You for using me. She’s wonderful. I pray
      I can help her continue to see how wonderful
      she is. I pray she comes to know You too. I don’t
      want her to know the world without You. It’s so
      dark out there. Thank You for Your light. Thank
      You for loving me so I can love others.<br><br>
      I’m not sure how I could have lost sight so
      quickly. I pray You watch over my emotions; I
      pray You keep them safe. Please take them
      captive to the obedience of Christ Jesus. Please
      cast down all high thoughts that do not align
      with who You are.<br><br>
      Please protect my heart soul and mind with the
      helmet of salvation, the chest plate of
      righteousness, the belt of truth, shield of faith,
      sword of the spirit, and shoes of the gospel.<br><br>
      I am nothing without You. I am not exempt to
      anything. It is Your strength alone that sets me
      apart.<br><br>
      I’m so sorry for doubting You. Oh, how weak I
      am alone. Thank You for Your forgiveness.
      Thank You for Your kindness. Thank You for
      Your love. Today, tomorrow, into forever. I am
      Yours Lord. Thank You for being my God.<br><br>
      Amen

    <p class="body-text">
      Dear Lord, I pray for Bryce.<br><br>
      I pray You help him to see His value too. I pray
      You help him to feel the Love only You can give.
      I pray that You flush all the guilt that may be
      there away. I pray You help him to feel like he is
      enough.<br><br>
      I’m sorry for the evil thoughts I’ve thought
      about him. I do not want to attack my brother.
      He is not the enemy. He never was and never
      will be. Thank You for Your forgiveness.<br><br>
      I pray for Your protection against the enemy.<br><br>
      He is brilliant Father, and I’m sorry for
      underestimating Him yesterday.<br><br>
      I don’t want to walk a single step without You.<br><br>
      Please be with us all Father God.<br><br>
      We need You today more than ever.<br><br>
      Amen Jesus, my God, the Protector of all that is
      good :)<br><br>
