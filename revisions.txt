general
- just make everything as close to xd as possible
- more fade transitions
- optimize for mobile

navigation menu 
- click to open/close
- highlight text
- transparent to background color

bottom bar
- put it all at the bottom of the page
- make it closer to xd file design

thoughts page
- image broken

image gallery
- get images from karson and add them to the page

i think the only funcitonality things I need to do still is small fixes for the sidebar & bottom menu, as well as some resizing for mobile. but besides that just making it look closer to the xd file
